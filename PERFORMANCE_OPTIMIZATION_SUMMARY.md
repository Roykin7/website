# STEMCity Labs - Performance Optimization Summary

## Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. Image Delivery Optimization âœ…

**Implemented:**
- Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all `<img>` tags for native lazy loading
- Added `decoding="async"` attribute for non-blocking image decoding
- Added `optimized-img` class for consistent styling and performance hooks
- Created image optimization script (`optimize-images.ps1`) for WebP conversion
- Implemented responsive image techniques with proper aspect ratios

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Carousel images optimized
- `about.html` - All team member photos optimized
- `events.html` - Event images optimized
- `goals.html` - Educational images optimized
- All other HTML files updated via `simple-perf-optimize.ps1`

**Benefits:**
- Reduced image loading time by deferring off-screen images
- Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by prioritizing visible content
- Better user experience with progressive loading

### 2. Efficient Cache Lifetimes âœ…

**Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive `.htaccess` file with cache control headers
- Set long cache lifetimes for static assets (1 year for images, 1 month for CSS/JS)
- Implemented HTML caching with appropriate revalidation (1 hour)
- Added compression (gzip/deflate) for text-based resources
- Configured HTTP/2 Server Push for critical resources

**Cache Strategy:**
- **Images:** 1 year cache with immutable flag
- **CSS/JS:** 1 month cache with public flag
- **HTML:** 1 hour cache with must-revalidate
- **Fonts:** 1 year cache for web fonts

**Files Created:**
- `.htaccess` - Server-level cache configuration
- `service-worker.js` - Client-side caching with Cache API
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest for app-like caching

### 3. Render-Blocking Request Optimization âœ…

**Implemented:**
- **Critical CSS Inlining:** Extracted above-the-fold styles into `<style>` tags
- **CSS Deferring:** Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously using `media="print"` technique
- **JavaScript Deferring:** All scripts loaded with `defer` attribute
- **Resource Preloading:** Critical resources preloaded with `rel="preload"`
- **DNS Prefetching:** External resources prefetched to reduce DNS lookup time

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Inline critical CSS for immediate rendering
- Defer non-critical CSS until after page load
- Use `defer` attribute for JavaScript to prevent render blocking
- Preload critical resources (CSS, JS, fonts) for faster loading
- DNS prefetch for external domains (Google Fonts)

**Files Modified:**
- `index.html` - Full render-blocking optimization
- `templates/optimized-template.html` - Template for other pages
- `css/critical.css` - Extracted critical styles
- `js/performance-optimizer.js` - Enhanced with initialization logic

### 4. Additional Performance Enhancements âœ…

**Service Worker Implementation:**
- Offline caching for core website functionality
- Background sync for improved reliability
- Cache versioning for efficient updates

**Progressive Web App Features:**
- Web app manifest for installability
- Theme color and display optimization
- App icons and metadata

**JavaScript Optimizations:**
- Intersection Observer for efficient lazy loading
- Image optimization with modern format detection
- Resource hints for faster subsequent loads

## Performance Metrics Expected Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Large image files (up to 6.35 MB)
- Render-blocking CSS and JavaScript
- No caching strategy
- No lazy loading

### After Optimization:
- **LCP Improvement:** 40-60% faster due to image optimization and critical CSS
- **FCP Improvement:** 30-50% faster due to render-blocking elimination
- **CLS Improvement:** Better due to proper image sizing and loading
- **Load Time:** 50-70% faster on repeat visits due to caching
- **Lighthouse Score:** Expected increase from ~60 to 90+
