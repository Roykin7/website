   - Full Name (required)
   - Email Address (required)
   - Phone Number (optional)
   - Organization/School (optional)

3. **Test the form** - Fill it out and check Google Forms responses

### Manual Setup (if you prefer):

1. **Get your Google Form URL** (the one ending with `/viewform`)
2. **View form source code** and find entry IDs (`entry.123456789`)
3. **Edit `contact.html`** and replace:
   - `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
   - `entry.NAME_FIELD` with your actual entry IDs
4. **Update the fallback link** with your form URL

## 📊 What Happens When Someone Submits

1. **User fills out form** on your website
2. **Form validates** (client-side validation)
3. **Data submits to Google Forms** (invisible to user)
4. **User sees success message** on your website
5. **You get email notification** from Google Forms
6. **Data saved to Google Sheets** automatically
